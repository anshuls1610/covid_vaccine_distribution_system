### Scope

The goal of this project is to create a Covid Vaccine Distribution System that can be used to track citizens' immunization status and understand the patient's vaccination history to determine whether or not the person is eligible to receive the vaccine. In order to distribute the vaccine efficiently, a process for appointment booking will be developed. It can keep track of vaccine information such as its availability, manufacturer, supplier name, hospitals & vaccination centers, and so on.


### Proposal
###### Following is the proposal for the project:

To create a generalized vaccine table with the information and rules for covid vaccine.
To create a list of suppliers for the vaccines and purchase them and distribute them to the hospitals.
To create a list of people registered with their government ids and their vaccination history information.
To create a list of hospitals with zip codes to check for availability of vaccines and book an appointment by searching for zip codes if the person is eligible to take the vaccine.
To verify if the person is vaccinated.
